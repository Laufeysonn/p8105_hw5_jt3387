## Problem 1

The code chunk below imports the data in individual spreadsheets contained in `./data/zip_data/`. To do this, I create a dataframe that includes the list of all files in that directory and the complete path to each file. As a next step, I `map` over paths and import data using the `read_csv` function. Finally, I `unnest` the result of `map`.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
full_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/zip_data/"),
    path = str_c("data/zip_data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

The result of the previous code chunk isn't tidy -- data are wide rather than long, and some important variables are included as parts of others. The code chunk below tides the data using string manipulations on the file, converting from wide to long, and selecting relevant variables. 

```{r}
tidy_df = 
  full_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(group, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

Finally, the code chunk below creates a plot showing individual data, faceted by group. 

```{r}
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

This plot suggests high within-subject correlation -- subjects who start above average end up above average, and those that start below average end up below average. Subjects in the control group generally don't change over time, but those in the experiment group increase their outcome in a roughly linear way.

## Problem 2

Load the data.

```{r message = FALSE}
homicide_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
```

Description of the raw data:
  
  - The data set contain `r nrow(homicide_raw)` observations and `r ncol(homicide_raw)` variables.

- The key variables are: `uid` represents the identity of every record, `reported_data` represents the date when the homicide was reported, `victim_last` and `victim_first` show the last and first name of the victim, `victim_race`, `victime_age`, `victim_sex` show the race, age, and gender of the victim, `city` and `state` represents which city and state the homicide happened, `lat` and `lon` represent the latitude and longitude coordinates of the homicide, `disposition` represents the result of the homicide.

- `victim_age` is a character variable, and there are NAs and `unknown` values in it. I'll invert it into numeric. There are also NAs in `lat` and `lon` variables. There is a row with Tulsa as city and AL as state seems to have an error, so I'll remove this row.

Create the `city_state` variable.

```{r warning = FALSE}
homicide <- homicide_raw %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))
homicide_city <- homicide %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(total_homicide = n(),
            unsolved_homicide = sum(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | 
                                      disposition == "Open/No arrest")) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
homicide_city %>% knitr::kable() 
```

Use the `prop.test` function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved for Baltimore, MD.

```{r}
baltimore_df <- homicide_city %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 
baltimore_test <- prop.test(x = baltimore_df$unsolved_homicide, 
                            n = baltimore_df$total_homicide) %>%
  broom::tidy() 
baltimore_test %>%
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

- From the test result, we can see that the proportion of homicides which were unsolved was around 64.6% in Baltimore, MD, and the 95 percent confidence interval is [0.6276, 0.6632].

Run prop.test for each of the cities in the data set.

```{r}
ptest_tidy <- function(x, n){
  result <- prop.test(x = x, n = n) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
  result
}
citys_ptest <- homicide_city %>%
  mutate(result_df = purrr::map2(unsolved_homicide, total_homicide, 
                                 ~ptest_tidy(x = .x, n = .y))) %>% 
  unnest(result_df)
citys_ptest %>% knitr::kable() 
```
